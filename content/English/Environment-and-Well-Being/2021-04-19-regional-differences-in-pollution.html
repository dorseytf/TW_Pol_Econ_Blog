<h1>Environment as an Afterthought of Development</h1>
<p>It is a familiar story to most by this point: an impoverished country enters a phase of fast-paced growth and development, when new industries sprout up and cities swell, spurred on by governments focused on increased production and incomes above all else. Once the pace of growth slows after reaching middle/high income status, though, the detrimental impacts all of this growth has had on the environment is brought front and center by concerned citizens.</p>
<p>While most readers are probably already familiar with how this pattern played out in Taiwan at the national scale, I want to dive into how this has played out at the sub-national level. Do the types or sources of pollution differ across regions in Taiwan? Do these patterns reflect historical inequities from the authoritarian period? What policies could be enacted to improve environmental quality?</p>
