# What Data does an Empirical SFC Model Require?

In the canonical SFC text, [Godley and Lavoie (2012)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3) use purely theoretical models with numerical simulation. While these work well for exposition and theory purposes, I (and many others) are mostly interested in models based on real world data. This poses a very challenging problem, though, as many of the flows and stocks needed to make a fully consistent and thorough model are not explicitly produced by statistical agencies. But there are ways around this, and any model requires leaving out some level of detail, so it's not the end of the world. 

At a high level, since SFC models are focused on linking the real and financial sides of the economy, we know that we will need all the usual economic variables (GDP, Consumption, Government expenditures, etc.) plus financial data. The latter are usually provided by the Central Bank via the Flow of Funds data. 

With all the data in hand, we can put together an initial balance sheet to determine which sectors and assets will be significant enough to model. 


# An Initial Balance Sheet

As a first step, we take the Consolidated Assets and Liabilities data from [Taiwan's central bank](https://cpx.cbc.gov.tw/Tree/TreeSelect) and calculate each sector's net position (Assets - Liabilities) for each asset.
