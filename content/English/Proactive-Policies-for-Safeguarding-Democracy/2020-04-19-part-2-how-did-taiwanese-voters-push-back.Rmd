# The Rise of a Populist Candidate in Taiwan

As we saw in [Part 1](/english/proactive-policies-for-safeguarding-democracy/part-1-how-the-populist-wave-came-to-taiwan/) of this series, Taiwan shared many of the same factors as the US and European countries that set the stage for a right-wing populist candidate to rise to prominence. In addition to these shaky foundations, the opposition KMT party initiated a concentrated effort to sway public opinion by stoking resentment to pension reform, same-sex marriage, and labor law reforms. This campaign resulted in a [steadily decreasing approval rating](https://www.tpof.org/%e5%8f%b0%e7%81%a3%e6%94%bf%e6%b2%bb/%e7%b8%bd%e7%b5%b1%e8%81%b2%e6%9c%9b/%e7%b8%bd%e7%b5%b1%e8%81%b2%e6%9c%9b%e8%b6%a8%e5%8b%a2%e5%9c%96%ef%bc%8820165101911/) ^[@tpof_tsai_approval] for President Tsai Ing-wen in the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections. 

![Fig 1: President Tsai Ing-wen Approval Ratings (May 2016 - November 2019) - Green line is Percentage of Respondents Approving, Red line is Percentage of Respondents Not Approving, Gray Line is Unknown/No Opinion](/English/Proactive-Policies-for-Safeguarding-Democracy/2020-04-19-part-2-how-did-taiwanese-voters-push-back_files/總統聲望.jpg)

Against this backdrop, Han Kuo-yu, a member of the KMT with relatively little name recognition (up to this point his previous experience included a stint as a legislator during the 90s and as president of the Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Corporation), began a meteoric rise to prominence on the Taiwanese political scene, first as a candidate for chairman of the KMT (he came in 4th with less than 6% of the vote), and then as populist candidate for mayor of Taiwan's 2nd-largest city, Kaoshiung. From its status as a second-class industrial city under KMT rule, Kaoshiung was the home of many pro-democracy groups and newspapers during the Martial Law period, and had been a stronghold of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for decades.^[@dip_reichenbach] However, Han successfully leveraged lingering discontent over uneven development and lower incomes compared to the capital Taipei, and combined it with [(very) lofty promises](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/01/18/2003708150) of casinos, a Disney theme park, Formula 1 racing, and making Kaoshiung the richest city in Taiwan, among others.^[@tpe_times_han_promises] 

While initially [seen as a longshot](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2018/07/28/2003697529)^[@tpe_times_han_survey_18] against the DPP's incumbent mayor of Kaoshiung, Han followed much the same trajectory as Donald Trump and quickly climbed in the polls thanks to his "outsider" image and social media presence. Han's rising popularity also lifted the fortunes of the [KMT as a whole](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2018/11/26/2003704948)^[@tpe_times_han_18], winning over independent voters^[@tpof_party_id] and leading to the KMT winning several powerful mayorships and 9 additional seats in the legislature.^[@morris_18]

Fig 2: Party Identification Trends in Taiwan - 2016/05 to 2019/11. Han's rise in popularity leading up to the 2018 Mayoral election (held on 2018-11-24) coincided with a large shift of independent/neutral voters to identifying with the KMT.

However, Han's supporters were not satisfied with a mere mayorship and almost immediately began calling for him to run for President in the 2020 election. Apparently in full agreement, Han agreed to run for President only 6 months after his inauguration as Kaoshiung mayor.

# The Major Issues Leading Up to the 2020 Presidential Election
While the situation looked bleak for the incumbent Tsai in the early stages of campaigning, several major issues, both within and outside of Taiwan, led to massive shifts in public opinion in Tsai's favor. 

## External Issues

### 1. Hong Kong Protests and China's Crackdown
Beginning in June of 2019, [protests against a new extradition bill](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695)^[@bbc_hk_protest] broke out in Hong Kong, flooding the streets with hundreds of thousands of protestors. After China cracked down hard, the protests escalated and continued, leading to pro-democracy candidates sweeping the local elections. In Taiwan, the constant media coverage and discussions on social media [galvanized public opinion](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-48580187) ^[@bbc_hk_tw] in favor of protecting Taiwanese sovereignty^[@tpof_ind] and moving futher [away from Chinese influence](https://www.watchinese.com/article/2019/24491).^[@watch_hk]
