<h1>The Rise of a Populist Candidate in Taiwan</h1>
<p>As we saw in <a href="/English/2020/part-1-how-the-populist-wave-came-to-taiwan/">Part 1</a> of this series, Taiwan shared many of the same factors as the US and European countries that set the stage for a right-wing populist candidate to rise to prominence. In addition to these shaky foundations, a concentrated effort to sway public opinion by the opposition KMT party resulted in a <a href="https://www.tpof.org/%e5%8f%b0%e7%81%a3%e6%94%bf%e6%b2%bb/%e7%b8%bd%e7%b5%b1%e8%81%b2%e6%9c%9b/%e7%b8%bd%e7%b5%b1%e8%81%b2%e6%9c%9b%e8%b6%a8%e5%8b%a2%e5%9c%96%ef%bc%8820165101911/">steadily decreasing approval rating</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> for President Tsai Ing-wen in the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections.</p>

<p>Against this backdrop, Han Kuo-yu, a member of the KMT with relatively little name recognition (up to this point his previous experience included a stint as a legislator during the 90s and as president of the Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Corporation), began a meteoric rise to prominence on the Taiwanese political scene, first as a candidate for chairman of the KMT (he came in 4th with less than 6% of the vote), and then as populist candidate for mayor of Taiwan’s 2nd-largest city, Kaoshiung. From its status as a second-class industrial city under KMT rule, Kaoshiung was the home of many pro-democracy groups and newspapers during the Martial Law period, and had been a stronghold of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for decades.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, Han successfully leveraged lingering discontent over uneven development and lower incomes compared to the capital Taipei, and combined it with <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/01/18/2003708150">(very) lofty promises</a> of casinos, a Disney theme park, Formula 1 racing, and making Kaoshiung the richest city in Taiwan, among others.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
