<h1>The Rise of a Populist Candidate in Taiwan</h1>
<p>As we saw in <a href="/english/proactive-policies-for-safeguarding-democracy/part-1-how-the-populist-wave-came-to-taiwan/">Part 1</a> of this series, Taiwan shared many of the same factors as the US and European countries that set the stage for a right-wing populist candidate to rise to prominence. In addition to these shaky foundations, the opposition KMT party initiated a concentrated effort to sway public opinion by stoking resentment to pension reform, same-sex marriage, and labor law reforms. This campaign resulted in a <a href="https://www.tpof.org/%e5%8f%b0%e7%81%a3%e6%94%bf%e6%b2%bb/%e7%b8%bd%e7%b5%b1%e8%81%b2%e6%9c%9b/%e7%b8%bd%e7%b5%b1%e8%81%b2%e6%9c%9b%e8%b6%a8%e5%8b%a2%e5%9c%96%ef%bc%8820165101911/">steadily decreasing approval rating</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> for President Tsai Ing-wen in the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections.</p>

<p>Against this backdrop, Han Kuo-yu, a member of the KMT with relatively little name recognition (up to this point his previous experience included a stint as a legislator during the 90s and as president of the Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Corporation), began a meteoric rise to prominence on the Taiwanese political scene, first as a candidate for chairman of the KMT (he came in 4th with less than 6% of the vote), and then as populist candidate for mayor of Taiwan’s 2nd-largest city, Kaoshiung. From its status as a second-class industrial city under KMT rule, Kaoshiung was the home of many pro-democracy groups and newspapers during the Martial Law period, and had been a stronghold of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for decades.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, Han successfully leveraged lingering discontent over uneven development and lower incomes compared to the capital Taipei, and combined it with <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/01/18/2003708150">(very) lofty promises</a> of casinos, a Disney theme park, Formula 1 racing, and making Kaoshiung the richest city in Taiwan, among others.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>While initially <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2018/07/28/2003697529">seen as a longshot</a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> against the DPP’s incumbent mayor of Kaoshiung, Han followed much the same trajectory as Donald Trump and quickly climbed in the polls thanks to his “outsider” image and social media presence. Han’s rising popularity also lifted the fortunes of the <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2018/11/26/2003704948">KMT as a whole</a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, winning over independent voters<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and leading to the KMT winning several powerful mayorships and 9 additional seats in the legislature.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="/English/Proactive-Policies-for-Safeguarding-Democracy/2020-04-19-part-2-how-did-taiwanese-voters-push-back_files/figure-html/tw_party_id-1.png" width="672" />
Fig 2: Party Identification Trends in Taiwan - 2016/05 to 2019/11. Han’s rise in popularity leading up to the 2018 Mayoral election (held on 2018-11-24) coincided with a large shift of independent/neutral voters to identifying with the KMT.</p>
<p>However, Han’s supporters were not satisfied with a mere mayorship and almost immediately began calling for him to run for President in the 2020 election. Apparently in full agreement, Han announced his bid for President only 6 months after his inauguration as Kaoshiung mayor. His campaign focused on building significantly closer political as well as economic ties with China, lofty (an often impossible) promises, <a href="https://sentinel.tw/the-han-kuo-yu-craze-threatens-democracy/">laughably obvious fabrications</a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> , and often misogynistic attacks on his opponent, Tsai Ing-wen.</p>

<h1>The Major Issues Leading Up to the 2020 Presidential Election</h1>
<p>While the situation looked bleak for the incumbent Tsai in the early stages of campaigning, several major issues, both within and outside of Taiwan, led to massive shifts in public opinion in Tsai’s favor.</p>

<div id="hong-kong-protests-and-chinas-crackdown" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Hong Kong Protests and China’s Crackdown</h3>
<p>Beginning in June of 2019, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695">protests against a new extradition bill</a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> broke out in Hong Kong, flooding the streets with hundreds of thousands of protestors. After China cracked down hard, the protests escalated and continued, leading to pro-democracy candidates sweeping the local elections. In Taiwan, the constant media coverage and discussions on social media <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-48580187">galvanized public opinion</a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> in favor of protecting Taiwanese sovereignty<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and moving futher <a href="https://www.watchinese.com/article/2019/24491">away from Chinese influence</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Despite China’s efforts to manipulate Taiwan’s media and spread disinformation online in the lead up to the 2020 election (see my <a href="/english/proactive-policies-for-safeguarding-democracy/part-1-how-the-populist-wave-came-to-taiwan/">previous post</a>), the Hong Kong protests <a href="https://www.storm.mg/article/2130944">significantly weakened China’s effectiveness</a> at swaying public opinion in Taiwan.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In fact, Han Kuo-yu’s support for the 1992 Consensus and the “One Country, Two Systems” model as practiced in Hong Kong became a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-50939354">major liability</a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> as the protests and crackdown dragged on.</p>

<h3>1. Han Kuo-yu’s Poor Performance in Kaoshiung</h3>
<p>Despite his lofty campaign promises, Han was apparently always more interested in running for president than being mayor of Kaoshiung. So much so, in fact, that in the time between his inauguration and beginning his presidential campaign, he <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/taiwans-democracy-is-utterly-confounded-by-populist-mayor-han-kuo-yu/">accomplished little</a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and had <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2019/05/10/2003714876">disastrous city council appearances</a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>. Kaoshiung residents grew so dissatisfied that <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3043074/kaohsiung-braced-rival-political-rallies-and-against-taiwan">large protests</a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> took place against the <a href="https://www.storm.mg/article/2060606">“runaway mayor”</a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> (which has since evolved into a recall movement that is slated to go before voters in June 2020).</p>

<h3>2. The Youth Vote</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.tfd.org.tw/export/sites/tfd/files/download/democracy_in_Taiwan_20180323_rev_Hsu3_04032018-1.pdf">Surveys show</a> that younger Taiwanese are significantly more likely to hold a positive view of democracy than older generations, and are also significantly more skeptical of authoritarian regimes than both older Taiwanese and even young people in the US and Europe.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>Additionaly, over 80% of Taiwanese aged 20-29 <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-51031941">identify as Taiwanese</a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and not Chinese. Despite initial fears among pundits about turnout among young voters, Taiwan’s youth acted on these beliefs and <a href="https://international.thenewslens.com/feature/taiwan2020/129897">mobilized en masse</a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> to become a primary electoral force in the 2020 election. Taiwanese youth began organizing as online fact-checkers, street canvassers, and worked to convince Han-supporting elderly friends and relatives to “wake up” from the Han-craze.</p>
<p>The DPP noticed these generational gaps in opinion as well as the proactive mobilization of younger Taiwanese, and given that the KMT’s voter base is mostly older, decided that working with young people to ensure turnout would be crucial to winning the election. So in addition to running ad campaigns urging young people to return home to vote<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> (see footnote for explanation on how voting works in Taiwan), the DPP also threw their support behind several young legislative candidates looking to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/10/taiwan-election-squad-youth-china-tsai-ing-wen">shake up Taiwanese politics</a> (a ragtag group straight out of an 80s movie, its members included a cosplayer, a death metal singer, a former special forces officer, and a former movie producer running as a member of a pro-Independence third party).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<h1>What Really Drove the 2020 Election Results</h1>
<p>In order to analyze this question in a robust way, I utilize a relatively new approach known as <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2694998">Specification Curve Analysis</a>, or SCA.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> At a high level, SCA seeks to avoid arbitrary and potentially motivated model/variable specifications by running all theoretically justified analytic specifications and testing the results as a whole to determine significance; or as Julia Rohrer put it, <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/run-all-the-models-dealing-with-data-analytic-flexibility">“Run all the models!”</a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>In the interest of brevity, I will only present a short overview of the variables and models used, along with a discussion of the main findings. For a full walk-through, as well as the code and data, see the <a href="https://github.com/dorseytf/Blog-Replication-Scripts">SCA replication file</a> on my GitHub.</p>
