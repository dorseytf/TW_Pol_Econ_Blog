<p><a href="/english/proactive-policies-for-safeguarding-democracy/part-1-how-the-populist-wave-came-to-taiwan/">Previously</a>, we covered how trends in the economy and media over the last several decades laid the groundwork for growing discontent that right-wing populists have been able to leverage to gain political power. However, in <a href="/english/proactive-policies-for-safeguarding-democracy/part-2-how-did-taiwanese-voters-push-back/">Part 2</a>, we also saw how Taiwan was able to avoid this same fate by 1) leveraging external factors that worked against the populist candidate, and 2) taking a proactive stance toward some of the underlying economic and media factors. Here, I will expand on economic policies that Taiwan (and others) should consider to strengthen support for democracy.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Recap on Populism’s Economic Factors</h1>
<p>Here, I present a quick recap of the underlying economic factors that can lead to surges in popularity for populist candidates.</p>
<div id="inequality" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Inequality</h2>
<p>Taiwan, as with most democracies throughout the world, has seen income and wealth inequality increase dramatically over the past several decades, leading to growing discontent aimed at those at the top.</p>

<p>There is already a large body of research focusing on <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/12-15-16sfp.pdf">tax policy</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> for <a href="http://www.oecd.org/economy/labour/49421421.pdf">reducing</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w17616.pdf">income</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and wealth inequality. Given that this topic is not my expertise, I will refer interested readers to this existing body of work.</p>
</div>
<div id="housing-prices" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Housing Prices</h2>
<p>Home prices in nearly every major metropolitan area have risen significantly, creating housing affordability crises in many countries around the world.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 2: Quarterly Housing Median Multiple for Taiwan and Taipei. A value above 5.1 is considered Extremely Unaffordable</em></p>
</div>
<p>While we see from the evidence in Figure 2 that Taiwan is also battling a housing affordability crisis, work by Hu (2015) and others has already laid out housing policy to <a href="http://www.econ.sinica.edu.tw/UpFiles/2013090214141704234/Periodicals_Pdf2013090215154369017/EC452-3.pdf">reduce speculation and control housing affordability</a> that is specific to the case of Taiwan, so I will defer to their expertise on this subject.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="stagnant-earnings-and-unemployment" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Stagnant Earnings and Unemployment</h2>
<p>Earnings for most workers in countries around the world have largely been stagnant for quite some time, making price increases more painful for most people.</p>

<p>This issue has proven to be multi-faceted and difficult, especially given the relative dearth of research on the topic. Therefore, I will focus my efforts in this post on providing a solution to the interrelated issues of wage stagnation and under/unemployment: a Job Guarantee Program. In addition to providing a theoretical justification, I will also describe what a Job Guarantee (JG) might look like in Taiwan, and provide estimates of its effects on Taiwan’s economy.</p>
