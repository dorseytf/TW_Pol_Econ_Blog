[Previously](/english/proactive-policies-for-safeguarding-democracy/part-1-how-the-populist-wave-came-to-taiwan/), we covered how trends in the economy and media over the last several decades laid the groundwork for growing discontent that right-wing populists have been able to leverage to gain political power. However, in [Part 2](/english/proactive-policies-for-safeguarding-democracy/part-2-how-did-taiwanese-voters-push-back/), we also saw how Taiwan was able to avoid this same fate by 1) leveraging external factors that worked against the populist candidate, and 2) taking a proactive stance toward some of the underlying economic and media factors. Here, I will expand on the replicable policies that other countries can adopt, as well as lay out additional policies that Taiwan and others should consider to strengthen their democracies.
