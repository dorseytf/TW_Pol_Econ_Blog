[Previously](/english/proactive-policies-for-safeguarding-democracy/part-1-how-the-populist-wave-came-to-taiwan/), we covered how trends in the economy and media over the last several decades laid the groundwork for growing discontent that right-wing populists have been able to leverage to gain political power. However, in [Part 2](/english/proactive-policies-for-safeguarding-democracy/part-2-how-did-taiwanese-voters-push-back/), we also saw how Taiwan was able to avoid this same fate by 1) leveraging external factors that worked against the populist candidate, and 2) taking a proactive stance toward some of the underlying economic and media factors. Here, I will expand on the replicable policies that other countries can adopt, as well as lay out additional policies that Taiwan and others should consider to strengthen their democracies.

# Recap on the Causes of Populism
Here, I present a quick recap of the underlying economic and media factors that can lead to populist surges in democracies.

## Economic Factors

### Inequality
Taiwan, as with most democracies throughout the world, has seen income and wealth inequality increase dramatically over the past several decades, leading to growing discontent aimed at those at the top.

### Stagnant Earnings and Unemployment
Earnings for most workers in democracies around the world have largely been stagnant for quite some time, making price increases more painful for most people.

### Housing Prices
Home prices in nearly every major metropolitan area have risen significantly, creating housing crises in many countries.

## Media Factors

### Partisanship in the Media
Not only can highly partisan media outlets, both in traditional media and on social media, spread populist viewpoints and talking points, but even in mainstream media the discourse has shifted toward populist talking points, lending credibility and shifting the framing of debate.

### Greater Audiences
The proliferation of social media and the willingness of traditional media to give attention to populist candidates have allowed populist talking points and fake news to reach ever-larger audiences.

# Policies to Address Economic Factors

A great deal of research has already been done on the topic of crafting [tax policy](https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/12-15-16sfp.pdf)^[@cbpp_tax] to [reduce](http://www.oecd.org/economy/labour/49421421.pdf)^[@oecd_tax] [income](https://www.nber.org/papers/w17616.pdf)^[@piketty_tax] and wealth inequality, so here I will instead focus on how to tackle the issues of stagnant wages, unemployment, and rising housing prices.
