[Previously](/english/proactive-policies-for-safeguarding-democracy/part-1-how-the-populist-wave-came-to-taiwan/), we covered how trends in the economy and media over the last several decades laid the groundwork for growing discontent that right-wing populists have been able to leverage to gain political power. However, in [Part 2](/english/proactive-policies-for-safeguarding-democracy/part-2-how-did-taiwanese-voters-push-back/), we also saw how Taiwan was able to avoid this same fate by 1) leveraging external factors that worked against the populist candidate, and 2) taking a proactive stance toward some of the underlying economic and media factors. Here, I will expand on economic policies that Taiwan (and others) should consider to strengthen support for democracy.

# Recap on Populism's Economic Factors
Here, I present a quick recap of the underlying economic factors that can lead to surges in popularity for populist candidates. 

## Inequality
Taiwan, as with most democracies throughout the world, has seen income and wealth inequality increase dramatically over the past several decades, leading to growing discontent aimed at those at the top.

There is already a large body of research focusing on [tax policy](https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/12-15-16sfp.pdf)^[@cbpp_tax] for [reducing](http://www.oecd.org/economy/labour/49421421.pdf)^[@oecd_tax] [income](https://www.nber.org/papers/w17616.pdf)^[@piketty_tax] and wealth inequality. Given that this topic is not my expertise, I will refer interested readers to this existing body of work. 


## Housing Prices
Home prices in nearly every major metropolitan area have risen significantly, creating housing affordability crises in many countries around the world.

While we see from the evidence in Figure 2 that Taiwan is also battling a housing affordability crisis, work by Hu (2015) and others has already laid out housing policy to [reduce speculation and control housing affordability](http://www.econ.sinica.edu.tw/UpFiles/2013090214141704234/Periodicals_Pdf2013090215154369017/EC452-3.pdf) that is specific to the case of Taiwan, so I will defer to their expertise on this subject.^[@hu_15]


## Stagnant Earnings and Unemployment
Earnings for most workers in countries around the world have largely been stagnant for quite some time, making price increases more painful for most people.

![*Figure 3: Real Monthly Earnings in Taiwan have stagnated*](/post/2020-03-30-part-1-how-the-populist-wave-came-to-taiwan_files/Real Monthly Earnings in Taiwan.jpg)

This issue has proven to be multi-faceted and difficult, especially given the relative dearth of research on the topic. Therefore, I will focus my efforts in this post on providing a solution to the interrelated issues of wage stagnation and under/unemployment: a Job Guarantee Program. In addition to providing a theoretical justification, I will also describe what a Job Guarantee (JG) might look like in Taiwan, and provide estimates of its effects on Taiwan's economy.
