Hi there! My name is Travis Dorsey. I have a Master's degree in International Political Economy and I am a data scientist by trade. In this blog I use data analysis to explore a variety of topics on the relationship between politics and economics in Taiwan. In particular, I focus on new policies that can be adopted to secure a free and open democracy with an economy that works for everyone.
